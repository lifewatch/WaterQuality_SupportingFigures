# Introduction
Through regular sampling surveys, the Flanders Marine Institute is generating long term data series for the Belgian coastal water and sand bank systems, a designated site in the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network. The data series is built on sampling activities initiated in 2002, but gradually upgraded and extended in the framework of the LifeWatch marine observatory and the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) participation. Nine nearshore stations are sampled monthly, with additional seasonal sampling of eight offshore stations. 

# Information on this repository
The codes in this repository are made publically accessible in order to support the datapaper “Mortelmans J, Deneudt K, Cattrijsse A, Beauchard O, Daveloose I, Vyverman W, Vanaverbeke J, Timmermans J, Peene J, Roose P, Knockaert M, Chou L, Sanders R, Stinchcombe M, Kimpe P, Lammens V, Theetaert H, Gkritzalis T, Hernandez F, Mees J. (2019, submitted to Nature Scientific Data). Nutrient, pigment, suspended matter and turbidity measurements in the Belgian Part of the North Sea.”

# Usage notes
This repository contains all scripts and dataframes to regenerate all figures in the above datapaper. One contraint is seen in the provided dataframe, in which all measurements are omitted. However, these measurements are not necessary to regenerate the figures, and these measurements are continously accessible via the fixed dataset on https://doi.org/10.14284/328. By using this fixed dataset, we guarantee the most recent dataset is provided and avoid duplicate versions.
